### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Graduated in the Computer Graphics field with the "Image, Development and 3D Technologies" Master's degree, I'm looking for a job in Canada (QC) or in Lyon (France) as videogame programmer or as engineer in computer graphics.

As a Minecraft fan, I also create mods during my free time. What I like in this, is to be able to create and to make people happy by communicating with them about a topic that we both love. This would be a pleasure to achieve the same thing for any videogame as a job.
