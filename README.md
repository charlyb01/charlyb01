### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Charly

Graduated in the Computer Graphics, I'm looking for a job as a **C++ Developer** in Canada.  
Very interested in ***complex problem solving***, with ***team spirit*** and ***willingness to learn***.

As a ***Minecraft*** fan, I also create mods during my free time. What I like in this, is to be able
to create and to make people happy by communicating with them about a topic that we both love.
This would be a pleasure to achieve the same thing for any ***videogame*** as a job, or any other
subject that would fascinate me, such as ***geometric modeling***, ***procedural generation***, or
***science*** related work.
